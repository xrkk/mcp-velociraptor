# Velociraptor MCP
Velociraptor MCP is a POC Model Context Protocol bridge for exposing LLMs to MCP clients.

> Development status: the bridge now starts on MCP Python SDK 2.1.1 through
> `MCPServer`, and the shared Windows-only target/result/pagination foundation is
> in place. The existing product tools are still the legacy transition surface;
> their replacement by the evaluated Windows tool set is handled in the next
> implementation stages. Do not interpret the current legacy inventory or JSON
> text envelopes as the final interface.

Initial version has several Windows orientated triage tools deployed. Best use is querying usecase to target machine name.

e.g 

`can you give me all network connections on MACHINENAME and look for suspicious processes?`

`can you tell me which artifacts target the USN journal`




## Installation

This project currently supports Windows acceptance only. Linux is a future TODO;
macOS is not supported. `requirements.lock` is the exact Windows acceptance
environment, while `requirements.txt` pins the direct project dependencies.

Create a virtual environment and install the reproducible set with:

```text
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.lock
```

### 1. Setup an API account
https://docs.velociraptor.app/docs/server_automation/server_api/

Generate an api config file:

`velociraptor --config /etc/velociraptor/server.config.yaml config api_client --name api --role administrator,api api_client.yaml`

### 2. Clone mcp-velociraptor repo and test API

- Copy `api_client.yaml` to the repo root, or keep it anywhere local and set `VELOCIRAPTOR_API_CONFIG=/path/to/api_client.yaml`.
- Copy `example.env` to `.env` for local development, then set `VELOCIRAPTOR_API_CONFIG` to your real `api_client.yaml` path. The bridge, smoke script, and agent load dotenv config automatically without overriding variables already supplied by your shell or MCP client.
- `api_client.yaml` is gitignored and should not be committed.
- Run `.venv/bin/python test_api.py` to confirm the API works when `.env` is configured, or use `VELOCIRAPTOR_API_CONFIG=/path/to/api_client.yaml .venv/bin/python test_api.py` to override it for a single run.
- The MCP bridge reads the same `VELOCIRAPTOR_API_CONFIG` environment variable after loading dotenv config.
- For multi-tenant deployments, optionally set `VELOCIRAPTOR_ORG_ID` to choose a default org context.
- Set `VELOCIRAPTOR_DEBUG_VQL=1` only when you want raw VQL request logging on stderr for debugging.
- Set `ENABLE_DANGEROUS_TOOLS=true` only when you explicitly want to enable raw VQL, quarantine, and remote process-kill tools.
- The agent POC defaults to local Ollama summaries. Set `VELOCIRAPTOR_MODEL_PROVIDER=azure`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL` when you explicitly want Azure OpenAI summaries.

### 3. Connect to MCP client of choice

The easiest configuration is to run your venv python directly calling
`mcp_velociraptor_bridge.py`. You can either put values directly in the MCP
client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "velociraptor": {
      "command": "/path/to/venv/bin/python",
      "env": {
        "VELOCIRAPTOR_API_CONFIG": "/path/to/api_client.yaml",
        "VELOCIRAPTOR_ORG_ID": "O123"
      },
      "args": [
        "/path/to/mcp_velociraptor_bridge.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Or point the MCP client at a dotenv file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "velociraptor": {
      "command": "/path/to/venv/bin/python",
      "env": {
        "VELOCIRAPTOR_ENV_FILE": "/path/to/mcp-velociraptor/.env"
      },
      "args": [
        "/path/to/mcp_velociraptor_bridge.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Config precedence is: direct environment values from the MCP client or shell,
then `VELOCIRAPTOR_ENV_FILE` if set, then repo-local `.env`, then fallback
paths such as `./api_client.yaml` and `~/.config/api_client.yaml`.

The separate agent proof-of-concept lives under `agent_poc/`, but it is not
supported by the new Windows bridge contract and is excluded from current
acceptance. Its historical prototype behavior
includes an engagement manager that fans out to isolated, dynamically
allowlisted analysts in parallel. The `engagement` profile runs bounded
process, network, persistence, execution, user-activity, and system-inventory
roles; `deep` also opts into heavier filesystem and security roles. Evidence
collection is deterministic and synthesis is model-only per role. It supports local
Ollama summaries by default and opt-in Azure OpenAI API summaries via
environment configuration. Azure OpenAI mode sends collected evidence bundles
to the configured Azure API account for summarization. See
`agent_poc/README.md` for agent-specific usage and automation examples,
including verbose collection progress output with artifact names and row counts.

### 4. Tool Response Format

The new shared contract returns MCP-native `structuredContent`, an empty
`content` list, and the protocol `isError` flag. Success models contain only
fields that apply to that operation; errors use stable
`code/message/retryable/details` fields. Paged results use opaque canonical
`v1:<offset>` cursors, default to 50 rows, accept at most 250 rows, and enforce a
245554-byte limit on the complete serialized `structuredContent` object.

The legacy product tools have not yet been migrated in this stage. They still
emit transitional JSON text envelopes:

```json
{"ok": true, "data": {...}}
```

or

```json
{"ok": false, "error": "message"}
```

`collect_artifact` and `hunt_across_fleet` accept `parameters` as a structured
JSON object with scalar values or lists of scalar values, for example
`{"PathRegex": ".*", "Targets": ["_BasicCollection"]}`. Legacy compatibility
input can be supplied via `legacy_parameters` with simple scalar assignments or
list literals such as `PathRegex='.*',Targets=['_BasicCollection']`; raw VQL
fragments are no longer passed through.
Parameterized hunts are validated against Velociraptor's compiled collector
args; if the requested artifact env does not land, the hunt is stopped and the
tool returns an error.
`collect_forensic_triage` wraps `Windows.Triage.Targets` with
`Targets='["_BasicCollection"]'` and a collection timeout of `2400` seconds.

### 5. Tool Inventory

The current source still exposes the old Windows/Linux/macOS/fleet helpers
listed below. This is a transition inventory, not the approved final product
surface. Later stages replace it with the evaluated Windows-only tools and
remove obsolete registrations; Linux remains TODO and macOS will not be kept.

- Fleet: `list_orgs`, `client_info`, `list_clients`, `hunt_across_fleet`, `get_hunt_results_tool`, `run_vql`.
- Artifact discovery: `list_windows_artifacts`, `list_linux_artifacts`, and `list_macos_artifacts` accept `name_regex` filters and `include_parameter_details=true` for full live parameter metadata from `artifact_definitions()`.
- Linux: process, group, mount, network, users, crontab, services, SSH keys/logins, shell history, last login, ARP cache, journal search, file finder, and YARA process scanning.
- macOS: process, users, network, LaunchAgents/Daemons, login items, shell history, browser history, quarantine events, TCC database, file finder, and artifact discovery.
- Windows: process, network, scheduled tasks, services, RecentDocs, Shellbags, USB/mount evidence, execution traces, MFT, USN, SRUM, EVTX, PowerShell, autoruns, WMI persistence, RDP, DNS cache, Recycle Bin, browser history, memory/malfind/mutant checks, shadow copies, timestomp checks, and file/YARA hunting with optional hash calculation.
- Generic response/collection: `collect_artifact`, `get_collection_results`, `collect_forensic_triage`, `collect_file`, `quarantine_host`, `unquarantine_host`, and `kill_process`.

Thanks to [@snoe-findley](https://github.com/snoe-findley) for sharing a fork
that expanded available tools and some of the newer cross-platform additions.

### 6. Caveats

Due to the nature of DFIR, results depend on amount of data returned, model use and context window.

I have included a function to find artifacts and dynamically create collections but had mixed results.
I have been pleasantly surprised with some results and disappointed when running other collections that cause lots of rows.

Check licencing - Anthropic's DPA is only tied to their Commercial Terms, which means that for 
client/production endpoint data you would need commercial licencing to leverage this MCP. Other 
MCP clients work just fine.

Please let me know how you go and feel free to add PR!
