# Velociraptor Agent POC

> Historical prototype only. `agent_poc` is not supported by the new
> Windows-only MCP bridge contract and is excluded from the current acceptance
> scope. The commands and architecture below document the existing prototype;
> they are not a compatibility promise for the bridge migration.

### Setup
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cp example.env .env
ollama pull gemma4:e2b
```

### Usage
```bash
export VELOCIRAPTOR_API_CONFIG=/path/to/api_client.yaml
export VELOCIRAPTOR_MODEL_PROVIDER=ollama
export OLLAMA_MODEL=gemma4:e2b
.venv/bin/python -m agent_poc.mcp_agent RE-DEV -t engagement
```

Use Azure OpenAI with:
```bash
export VELOCIRAPTOR_MODEL_PROVIDER=azure
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://example-resource.openai.azure.com
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini
.venv/bin/python -m agent_poc.mcp_agent RE-DEV -t engagement
```

For Azure OpenAI, `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL` is the model/deployment name passed to
the API. Azure OpenAI mode sends the pre-collected evidence bundle to the
configured Azure API account for model summarization. Keep
`VELOCIRAPTOR_MODEL_PROVIDER=ollama` when endpoint evidence must remain local.

Optional for multi-tenant deployments:
```bash
export VELOCIRAPTOR_ORG_ID=O123
```

Run a different workflow with:
```bash
export VELOCIRAPTOR_API_CONFIG=/path/to/api_client.yaml
export VELOCIRAPTOR_MODEL_PROVIDER=ollama
export OLLAMA_MODEL=gemma4:e2b
.venv/bin/python -m agent_poc.mcp_agent RE-DEV -t process
```

Choose a readable text view instead of JSON with:
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m agent_poc.mcp_agent RE-DEV -t process --output-type text
```

Enable verbose MCP client diagnostics with role labels, collection names, row counts, and summarization progress:
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m agent_poc.mcp_agent RE-DEV -t engagement --output-type text -v
```

### Analysis Types
- **triage**: Quick check (processes, network, client info)
- **process**: Single-role process analysis
- **network**: Network connection analysis
- **persistence**: Scheduled task and service review
- **execution**: Evidence of execution artifacts
- **user_activity**: User activity, logon, browser, and shell-history review where supported
- **system_inventory**: Generic OS inventory such as users, groups, mounts, removable storage, and host state where supported
- **filesystem**: Focused filesystem/storage artifact review
- **security**: Security event and detection artifact review
- **engagement**: Bounded manager-led investigation across process, network, persistence, execution, user activity, and system inventory roles
- **deep**: Expanded investigation that also includes filesystem and security roles
- **full**: Alias for `engagement`

### Multi-Agent Design
- One deterministic engagement manager resolves `client_info`, selects analysts, and synthesizes the final case summary.
- Each analyst runs in a separate MCP session with its own conversation history.
- Evidence collection is deterministic in code. The model is used to summarize a pre-collected evidence bundle rather than choose tools free-form.
- Tool access is filtered dynamically per analysis type. For example, `execution` only gets execution tools, `engagement` gets bounded analyst roles, and `deep` opts into heavier filesystem and security roles.
- The agent supports Windows, Linux, and macOS role sets where the bridge has deterministic artifact helpers. Parameter-heavy tools such as hunts, arbitrary `collect_artifact`, YARA scans, quarantine, process kill, and broad file collection remain direct MCP tools rather than automatic agent steps.

### Integration Examples

These examples wrap the current host-focused `analyze_endpoint()` workflow.
They are suitable for calling the agent on one endpoint at a time from another
service or scheduler.

#### 1. API Endpoint (FastAPI)
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from agent_poc.mcp_agent import VelociraptorAgent

app = FastAPI()
agent = VelociraptorAgent()

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup():
    await agent.initialize()

@app.post("/analyze/{hostname}")
async def analyze(hostname: str, analysis_type: str = "triage"):
    return await agent.analyze_endpoint(hostname, analysis_type)
```

#### 2. Scheduled Task (APScheduler)
```python
from apscheduler.schedulers.asyncio import AsyncIOScheduler
from agent_poc.mcp_agent import VelociraptorAgent

agent = VelociraptorAgent()
scheduler = AsyncIOScheduler()

@scheduler.scheduled_job('interval', hours=4)
async def sweep_endpoints():
    critical_hosts = ["DC01", "WEB01", "DB01"]
    await agent.batch_analyze(critical_hosts, "triage")

scheduler.start()
```

#### 3. Alert Webhook Handler
```python
@app.post("/webhook/alert")
async def handle_alert(alert: dict):
    hostname = alert.get("hostname")
    if alert.get("severity") == "high":
        # Immediate deep analysis
        results = await agent.analyze_endpoint(hostname, "full")
        # Send to SOAR platform, ticketing system, etc.
        return results
```

### Output
Results are automatically saved to `./agent_poc/output/` as JSON files:
```
agent_poc/output/
  ├── WIN10-WS_engagement_20240115_143022.json
  ├── DC01_full_20240115_150033.json
  └── ...
```

Each result now includes:
- top-level case metadata such as `workflow`, `hostname`, `client_id`, `org_id`, `os_type`, and timestamps
- `manager_summary` for the final case-level synthesis
- `analysts` keyed by role with status, summary, allowed tools, timestamps, and duration
- `errors` and `skipped` for failed or unsupported analysts

## Configuration

Edit `agent_poc/mcp_agent.py` to customize:
- Model selection
- Output directory
- Workflow definitions
- Custom analysis logic

This POC agent is designed for per-host analysis. Cross-endpoint hunting,
global IOC correlation, and autonomous scope expansion are not first-class
features in the current implementation and should not be assumed from these
examples.

The bridge, smoke script, and agent load dotenv config automatically without
overriding variables already supplied by your shell or MCP client. Keep `.env`
and the referenced `api_client.yaml` local and out of version control. Set
`VELOCIRAPTOR_ENV_FILE=/path/to/.env` when an MCP client should load a dotenv
file from somewhere other than the repo root.
Set `VELOCIRAPTOR_DEBUG_VQL=1` only when you want raw VQL request logging on
stderr for debugging.
Set `VELOCIRAPTOR_AGENT_VERBOSE=1` only when you want MCP client connection,
collection progress, and tool-call diagnostics from the agent runtime without
using the CLI `-v` flag.
The agent reads `VELOCIRAPTOR_MODEL_PROVIDER` from the environment or `.env`
and defaults to `ollama`. Ollama mode reads `OLLAMA_MODEL` and defaults to
`gemma4:e2b`. Azure OpenAI mode reads `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL`, requires
`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` or `AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, requires
`AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, and defaults to `gpt-5.4-mini`.
Each `analyze_endpoint()` run resets prior manager chat state, and each analyst
uses its own isolated MCP session and conversation history.
For multi-tenant deployments, set `VELOCIRAPTOR_ORG_ID` for the default org, or
pass `org_id` directly to MCP tools such as `client_info`, `windows_pslist`,
`collect_artifact`, and `get_collection_results`.
Set `ENABLE_DANGEROUS_TOOLS=true` only when you explicitly want to enable raw
VQL, quarantine, and remote process-kill tools.

The legacy MCP tools used by this prototype return JSON text envelopes in the form
`{"ok": true, "data": ...}` or `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}`. Consumers
that call MCP tools directly should decode the JSON payload before reading the
tool result. New bridge tools will instead use MCP-native `structuredContent`;
this prototype has not been migrated to that contract.
For `collect_artifact`, use the `parameters` argument as a structured JSON
object with scalar values or lists of scalar values, such as
`{"PathRegex": ".*", "Targets": ["_BasicCollection"]}`. Legacy compatibility
input can be passed via `legacy_parameters` and is limited to simple scalar
assignments or list literals like `Targets=['_BasicCollection']`; raw VQL
fragments are rejected.
The `collect_forensic_triage` helper wraps `Windows.Triage.Targets` with
`Targets='["_BasicCollection"]'` and a collection timeout of `2400` seconds.
The MCP server also exposes expanded fleet, Linux, macOS, Windows, YARA, and
response helpers. The POC agent models deterministic Windows, Linux, and macOS
helpers as bounded analyst roles. Parameter-heavy or disruptive helpers remain
available to direct MCP clients and are not run automatically by agent profiles.
